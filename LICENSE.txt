───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This European Union Public Licence (the ‘EUPL’) applies to the Work (as defined
below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of the Work,
other than as authorised under this Licence, is prohibited (to the extent such
use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).

The Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as
defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the
copyright notice for the Work:

    Licensed under the EUPL

or has expressed by any other reasonable means his willingness to license under
the EUPL.

1. Definitions

In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning:

— ‘The Licence’: this Licence.

— ‘The Original Work’: the work or software distributed or communicated by the
  Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable
  Code as the case may be.

— ‘Derivative Works’: the works or software that could be created by the Licensee
  based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence does not
  define the extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work required
  in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is determined by
  copyright law applicable in the country mentioned in Article 15.

— ‘The Work’: the Original Work or its Derivative Works.

— ‘The Source Code’: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most
  convenient for people to study and modify.

— ‘The Executable Code’: any code which has generally been compiled and which is
  meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.

— ‘The Licensor’: the natural or legal person that distributes or communicates
  the Work under the Licence.

— ‘The Licensee’ or ‘You’: any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the
  Work under the terms of the Licence.

— ‘Distribution’ or ‘Communication’: any act of selling, giving, lending,
  renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making
  available, online or offline, copies of the Work or providing access to its
  essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal person.

2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence

The Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
sublicensable licence of indefinite duration (for the duration of the copyright
on the Work) to do the following:

  — use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,
  — reproduce the Work,
  — modify the Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,
  — communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display
    the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case
    may be, the Work,
  — distribute the Work or copies thereof,
  — lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,
  — sublicense rights in the Work or copies thereof.

Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports, and formats, whether now
known or later invented, as long as the terms and conditions of this Licence are
respected. In particular, this Licence does not grant You any rights over
trademarks or trade names belonging to the Licensor.

3. Communication of the Source Code

The Licensor provides You with a copy of the Work in Source Code form, or
indicates a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for
as long as the Licensor continues to distribute or communicate the Work.

4. Limitations on copyright

Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive You of the benefits of any
exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights holders of the
Work, of exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto.

5. Obligations of the Licensee

The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and
obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:

(a) Obligation to provide Source Code  
  When You distribute or communicate copies of the Work, or when You make
  Derivative Works available, You must provide a copy of the Source Code or
  indicate a repository where this Source Code is accessible.

(b) Copyleft clause  
  You may distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or Derivative
  Works under the terms of this Licence or of any later version of this Licence
  published by the European Commission.  
  You may not use or apply any other licence that would alter or restrict the
  rights granted by this Licence.

(c) Compatibility clause  
  If You distribute or communicate Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon
  both the Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, You may
  distribute those Derivative Works under the terms of that Compatible Licence.
  For the purpose of this clause, ‘Compatible Licence’ refers to the licences
  listed in the appendix of the EUPL, as may be updated by the European
  Commission to account for new versions of those licences.  
  When You distribute under a Compatible Licence, You must comply with the terms
  of that licence. In any case, You must make sure that You fulfil the
  obligations that the EUPL imposes on You (notably providing the Source Code).

(d) Indication of changes  
  If You modify the Work and distribute or communicate Derivative Works, You must
  attach to the modified files a prominent notice stating that You have modified
  the Work and the date of modification.

(e) Notices  
  You must keep intact all copyright, patent, or trademark notices and
  disclaimers included in the Work and reproduce them in the copies You
  distribute or communicate. You must add the notice described in Article 5(d)
  and, in case of Derivative Works, You must give appropriate credit to the
  authors of the Work.

(f) Technical protection measures  
  You may not impose any additional technical restrictions that would limit the
  rights granted to the recipients of the Work under the terms of this Licence.

6. Chain of Authorship

The original Licensor warrants that the copyright on the Original Work granted
hereunder is owned by him or licensed to him and that he has the right to grant
this Licence.  
Each contributor warrants that the modifications he makes to the Work are his
own original creation (or that he has the right to submit the modification) and
that he has the right to grant the rights described in this Licence.  
Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent
contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work under the
terms of this Licence.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous
contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or
‘bugs’.  
For that reason the Work is provided under the Licence on an ‘as is’ basis and
without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors,
accuracy, or non-infringement of third-party intellectual property rights.  
This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition
for the grant of any rights to the Work.

8. Disclaimer of Liability

Except in the case of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural
persons, the Licensor shall not be liable for any direct or indirect, material
or moral, damages of any kind arising out of the Licence or of the use of the
Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial
damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product-liability
laws as far as they apply to the Work.

9. Additional Agreements

While distributing or communicating the Work, You may choose to conclude an
additional agreement, defining obligations or services consistent with this
Licence. However, in accepting such an agreement, You may not restrict the
rights granted by this Licence or alter its terms and conditions.

10. Acceptance of the Licence

By exercising any rights granted by this Licence on the Work, You irrevocably
accept this Licence and all its terms and conditions.

11. Information to the public

In case of any Distribution or Communication of the Work by means of electronic
communication (for example, by offering access to the Work from a remote
location), the distribution channel or medium (for example, a website) must
provide to the public the information required by this Licence.

12. Termination of the Licence

The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.  
Such termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received
the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in
full compliance with the Licence.

13. Miscellaneous

Without prejudice to Article 9, the Licence represents the complete agreement
between the Parties as to the Work.  
If any provision of the Licence is held to be unenforceable, this will not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms and
conditions of the Licence.  
The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or new versions of
the EUPL, so far as required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the
rights granted by the Licence. New versions will be published with a unique
version number.

14. Jurisdiction

Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties,

— any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this Licence shall be
  subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member State where the
  Licensor resides or conducts its primary business;  
— this Licence shall be governed by the law of that Member State.
